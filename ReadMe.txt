Quickstart:-
------------

0) Install Java on each PC if you haven't already.  This can be downloaded from http://www.java.com/en/download/manual.jsp.

1) Run Start_Windows_Server.bat on the fastest PC you have.

2) Run Start_Windows_Client.bat on each of the players PC's (the PC running the server can also be used by a player).

3) Each player the enters the IP address of the PC running the server program.

4) Kill your opponents Wizard using the following keys:-

Keys:-
Arrow Keys - Scroll map
Space - Cast current selected spell.  Target with the mouse pointer if required.
D - Cast Disbelieve
I - Toggle Illusion on/off
N - Next spell
P - Prev spell
T - Teleport
1-9 - Select that spell.  If you press Shift as well, it will add 10 to the number (so siift-8 selects spell 18).  I'm afraid you will have to use N/P to select any spells numbered above 19.
RMB - Get info on creature the mouse is over.  Or clear selection.



Slightly More Detailed Instructions
-----------------------------------
For more details, see the Chaos web page at "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaos_(video_game)".

Each player controls a wizards, which has a growing amount of mana with which to cast their range of spells.  The idea of the game is to use these spells against the enemy wizards.

Select a spell using the keys above.  If the spell requires a target (such as an empty square or enemy creature) make sure the mouse if pointing to it at the time the spell is cast.

If you have Illusion selected, the creature will cost no mana.  However, it can be easily destroyed with a Disbelieve spell.

To move your wizard or a creature/creatures, select them by drawing a box around them by dragging the mouse from one corner of the box to another.  All creatures inside this will be selected.  Then simply click where you would like them to go, or an enemy creature if you would like them to attack that.
